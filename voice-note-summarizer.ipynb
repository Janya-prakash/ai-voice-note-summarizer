    "# AI Voice Note Summarizer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a simple AI pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transcribes a short `.wav` voice note into text using speech recognition (Google Web Speech API via the `speech_recognition` library).\n",
    "2. Summarizes the transcribed text into a shorter version using an extractive NLP summarization algorithm (LSA via the `sumy` library).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to prototype an **AI-based voice note summarizer** that can help quickly review the main points from recorded audio notes."
